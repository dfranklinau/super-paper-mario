Super Paper Mario 8-bit animation
================================================================================

Super-paper-what-now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a random attempt at faithfully recreating the 8-bit transformation
scene that appears whenever Mario grabs a
[Mega Star](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mega_Star).

See the [following YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnuDhFJaSm8)
for an example of this in animation in action.

Mario has been designed (by "hand", AKA putting the values in manuallyâ€”no
Illustrator) in SVG. The sky and ground are using run of the mill CSS
gradients.

The line and jumping animations are performed using the JavaScript animation
engine, [anime.js](http://anime-js.com).

Be sure to press Space (or tap) when Mario has finished animating!
